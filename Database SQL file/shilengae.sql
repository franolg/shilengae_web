You agree that it would be difficult to determine the amount of damages that will be suffered by you if the uptime will not be met. You also agree that the above compensation schedule will result in liquidated damages that bear a reasonable proportion to the probable loss and the amount of your actual loss. The aforementioned liquidated damages shall be the sole and exclusive remedy in the event the uptime has not been met by Usabilla. However, if the Products and/or Services are not available to you for a reason solely attributable to Usabilla for a continuing period of five (5) days or more, you may terminate your agreement in writing with immediate effect, and you may request return of fees paid by you related to the unavailable Products and/or Services, pro-rata the remaining unused term of your agreement.\\r\\nUsabilla and its licensors make no warranties or representations whatsoever with respect to the Website, Products, and Services, or any linked site or its content, including the content, information and materials on it or the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of the content, information and materials.

If you are dissatisfied with the Website, your sole remedy is to discontinue using the Website.\\r\\nNo advice, results or information, whether oral or written, obtained by you from Usabilla, or through the Website, shall create any warranty not expressly made herein. Usabilla does not necessarily endorse, support, sanction, encourage or agree with any content or any user content, or any opinion, recommendation, content, link, data or advice expressed or implied therein, and Usabilla expressly disclaims any and all liability in connection with user content and any other content, materials or information available on or through the Website, Products, and/or Services, created or provided by users or other third parties.\\r\\nPlease note that some jurisdictions may not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so some of the above exclusions may not apply to you. Check your local laws for any restrictions or limitations regarding the exclusion of implied warranties.\\r\\n11. Limitation of Liability of Usabilla, its Suppliers and its Licensors\\r\\nUnder no circumstances shall any party, its subsidiaries and affiliates, their respective directors, officers, employees or agents, and other representatives, be liable for any indirect, consequential, incidental, special, or punitive damages, including but not limited to lost profits and business interruption, whether in contract or in tort, including negligence, arising in any way from the use of the Website, Products, Services, and/or the Contents thereof, or of any hyperlinked website even if such party is expressly advised of the possibility of such damages.
